# OOP_Assignment3
This it the repository for my third OOP assignment.
I'm not 100% sure what I'm doing yet.

I will be doing an app. This app for an exercise program that I follow. The program is called "Candito 6 Week Strength Program" and is available for free here: http://www.canditotraininghq.com/free-strength-programs/

# Planned Features
[*] An input screen to enter your current stats
[*] An exercise program that will be generated based off the inputs above
[*] Each program will be composed of 6 weeks, each week will have 3 - 5 days
[*] There will be a number of views to the program
  [*] A summary view, showing a week by week summary
  [*] A week view, showing the individual days of each week
  [*] A day view, showing the exercises to be performed on each day
  [*] An exercise view which will allow to take notes / videos of a specific exercise
[*] Other features will be added as I think of them

This app will probably be quite simple so I am planning on doing something else if I have the time.
My other idea is the write a preprocessor for the Tesseract OCR engine.
Tesseract is an open source optical-character-recognition engine.
However, it requires a lot of work before the engine is somewhat able to recognise hand written text.
My goal would be to write a preprocessor that would automatically perform certain operations a picture of handwritten text before passing it to Tesseract to translate it to a text document.

I would really like to work on the Tesseract project however I have no idea how to do it or how much time it will take to produce something that works.
As a result of this I've decided to work mainly on the app as a kind of fallback.
